                While Steve Smith is regarded as arguably the best Test batter of this generation, his records in the
                shortest format were dismal. In fact, the middle-order sensation had to warm the bench for most of
                Australia's T20 World Cup 2022 campaign before getting a chance in the final Super 12 fixture against
                Afghanistan where he managed just a run-a-ball four.
                <br><br>
                However, Steven Smith has finally succeeded in proving his critics wrong by make his bat do the talking
                consistently in the ongoing Big Bash League (BBL) 2022 representing the Sydney Sixers where he has so
                far registered two centuries and a quickfire half-century.
                <br><br>
                All this has been possible for Smith after he decided to change his batting technique in order to get
                the desired results. In fact, former Australian cricketer Greg Blewett has analyzed on how the
                33-year-old has been scoring runs consistently in the ongoing BBL.

                Rohit Sharma scored a much-awaited hundred against New Zealand in the third and final ODI of the series,
                on Tuesday (January 24). He ended his century drought to register his 30th ODI hundred, and handed India
                a flying start while opening the batting alongside Shubman Gill at the Holkar Cricket Stadium in Indore.
                <br><br>
                The Indian skipper's last ODI hundred came three years ago in January 2019 against Australia. He scored
                83 against Sri Lanka earlier this month and 51 in the second ODI against New Zealand, and finally
                managed to reach the three-figure mark, treating his fans with an 83-ball century. He smashed nine fours
                and six sixes as he completed a century in the innings' 26th over but was dismissed by Michael
                Bracewell's delivery in the next over.
                <br><br>
                New Zealand won the toss and invited India to bat first after losing the opening two matches. Rohit and
                Shubman Gill gave India another good start and seemed settled from the start. Rohit cleared his
                intentions with two fours to Jacob Duffy's deliveries in the third over and never looked troubled with
                his shot selection. Though he struggled to convert the starts into big scores, Rohit finally managed to
                end the drought.

            <h1>ILT20 2023: Match 16, ABD vs GUL Match Prediction - Who will win today's ILT20 match between Abu Dhabi
                Knight Riders and Gulf Giants?</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                <iframe width="300" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0XWv2tY8VW0"

                Abu Dhabi Knight Riders have been pathetic in the ongoing International League T20 (ILT20). They have
                played five matches so far in the tournament but failed to win any. Next up, they are going to challenge
                Gulf Giants, who are currently leading the points charts. With a win, the James Vince-led side can
                solidify their place at the top of the table but the Knight Riders franchise cannot afford to lose
                again, as it can eliminate them from the competition.
                <br><br>
                Now, after winning four matches on the trot, the Gulf Giants suffered their first loss in the last match
                against Sharjah Warriors. Bowling first, they restricted the Warriors to 151 runs but failed to chase it
                down after a flop batting show. David Wiese and Chris Jordan tried to rescue the ship but it didn't work
                as they suffered a 21-run defeat. Despite that, there's not a lot to worry about at the moment. The team
                would expect to return back to winning ways when they take on the Knight Riders.
                <br><br>
                For the Abu Dhabi-based franchise, there currently are plenty of problems to deal with. None of their
                plans has worked so far and that's a massive reason to worry. Their batting finally lived up to the
                potential in the previous match against MI Emirates but their bowlers were disappointing yet again. Sri
                Lanka international, Dhananjaya de Silva, smashed 65 off 40 deliveries and he once again needs to play a
                similar kind of innings to bail the team out of this position. When it comes to bowlers, Andre Russell
                gave away 57 runs in four overs in the last match while all the other bowlers except Sunil Narine looked
                pale.
